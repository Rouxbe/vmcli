# VMCLI

A set of utilities to help you manage VMs with `Virtualization.framework`

![vmctl-demo](./docs/demos/vmctl.svg)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* macOS Big Sur (11+)
* XCode.app installed

```
# make sure xcode command-line tools are installed
xcode-select --install

# run build, install. This will install vmcli and vmctl to /usr/local/bin
make
sudo make install
```

You have now finished installing `vmcli` and `vmctl`

Set environment variable `VMCTLDIR` to `~/VMs` so `vmctl` knows how to find VMs.
If you don't set this, `vmctl` will use current working directory to find VMs.
```bash
echo 'export VMCTLDIR="$HOME/VMs"' >> ~/.zprofile
export VMCTLDIR="$HOME/VMs"
```

Provision a Ubuntu VM, and install that to `~/VMs`.
The VM will auto create your user with your ssh public key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
```bash
make build/vm/ubuntu
mv build/vm/ubuntu "${VMCTLDIR}/ubuntu"
```

Optionally expand the VM volume, for example to 16G.
```bash
dd if=/dev/null of="${VMCTLDIR}/ubuntu/disk.img" bs=1g count=0 seek=16
```

Optionally edit the VM config for more RAM and/or CPU cores
```bash
vi "${VMCTLDIR}/ubuntu/vm.conf"
```

Start the VM
```bash
vmctl start ubuntu
```

Attach to the serial console, use (CTRL+A - D to quit)
```
vmctl attach ubuntu
```

You can use `vmctl ip ubuntu` to check your VM IP.

Wait for the VM to boot and ssh into the VM
```
vmctl ssh ubuntu
```

You should shutdown the VM using ssh within the VM.
If that's not an option, you can forcibly shut it down.
```
vmctl stop ubuntu
```

## Known Issues

* Virtual Machine cannot be started with networking when InternetSharing is
  already enabled. See [#3](/../../issues/5).

### vmcli

```
USAGE: vmcli [--cpu-count <cpu-count>] [--memory-size <memory-size>] [--memory-size-suffix <memory-size-suffix>] [--disk <disk> ...] [--cdrom <cdrom> ...] [--network <network> ...] [--balloon <balloon>] [--bootloader <bootloader>] [--kernel <kernel>] [--initrd <initrd>] [--cmdline <cmdline>] [--escape-sequence <escape-sequence>]

OPTIONS:
  -c, --cpu-count <cpu-count>
                          CPU count (default: 1)
  -m, --memory-size <memory-size>
